Massless springs with a spring - constant of k connect them. On a plane that is inclined with angle $\\theta$ When under gravity, g Explanation: The discs' centers are shown by points P and Q. Our coordinate system is the distance along the incline. Refer to P and Q's locations as $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively. The slope is going in a positive direction. Step 2 Each disc's forces: Component of gravity along an incline: $mg\\sin\\theta$ spring pressures resulting from interconnected springs Explanation: Normal force, which is perpendicular to the slope and has no effect on motion along it Rolling without sliding is caused by friction. In order to roll without slipping: Angular acceleration $\\alpha$ and linear acceleration a are connected by the formula $a = r\\alpha$. $\\tau=I_0\\alpha$ for a rolling disc, where $\\tau$ is the torque. Step 3 1. For disc P (upper disc, $x_1$): - Force equation: $m(\\frac{d^{2}x_1}{dt^{2}})=mg\\sin\\theta - k(x_1)+k(x_2 - x_1)$ 2. For disc Q (lower disc, $x_2$): - Force equation: $m(\\frac{d^{2}x_2}{dt^{2}})=mg\\sin\\theta - k(x_2 - x_1)$ 3. Due to rolling constraint: - $I_0\\frac{d^{2}\\varphi_1}{dt^{2}} = F_{r1}$ (for disc P) - $I_0\\frac{d^{2}\\varphi_2}{dt^{2}} = F_{r2}$ (for disc Q) Explanation: where $\\varphi_1$ and $\\varphi_2$ are angular displacements and $F_{r1}$, $F_{r2}$ are friction forces Therefore, the final equations of motion are: $\\left(m + \\frac{I_0}{r^{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d^{2}x_1}{dt^{2}}\\right)=mg\\sin\\theta - k(x_1)+k(x_2 - x_1)$ $\\left(m+\\frac{I_0}{r^{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d^{2}x_2}{dt^{2}}\\right)=mg\\sin\\theta - k(x_2 - x_1)$ These are coupled second - order differential equations describing the motion of the two - disc system.

To find the gradient, you would typically calculate:\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Gradient} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta a}{\\\\Delta x} \\\\]\\n\\nAssuming the graph shows a linear relationship where the maximum acceleration \\\\(a_{\\\\text{max}}\\\\) corresponds to the maximum displacement \\\\(x_{\\\\text{max}}\\\\), the gradient can be calculated as:\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Gradient} = -\\\\frac{a_{\\\\text{max}}}{x_{\\\\text{max}}} \\\\]\\n\\nLet's assume the graph shows \\\\(a_{\\\\text{max}} = -20 \\\\ \\\\text{m/s}^2\\\\) and \\\\(x_{\\\\text{max}} = 0.25 \\\\ \\\\text{m}\\\\):\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Gradient} = -\\\\frac{-20}{0.25} = 80 \\\\ \\\\text{s}^{-2} \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the gradient is:\\n\\\\[ \\\\boxed{80} \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 2: Calculate the Frequency\\nThe gradient is \\\\(-\\\\omega^2\\\\), so:\\n\\\\[ \\\\omega^2 = 80 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ \\\\omega = \\\\sqrt{80} = 4\\\\sqrt{5} \\\\ \\\\text{rad/s} \\\\]\\n\\nThe frequency \\\\(f\\\\) is related to the angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) by:\\n\\\\[ f = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2\\\\pi} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ f = \\\\frac{4\\\\sqrt{5}}{2\\\\pi} = \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{5}}{\\\\pi} \\\\ \\\\text{Hz} \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the frequency is:\\n\\\\[ \\\\boxed{\\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{5}}{\\\\pi}} \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 3: Determine the Period\\nThe period \\\\(T\\\\) is the reciprocal of the frequency:\\n\\\\[ T = \\\\frac{1}{f} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2\\\\sqrt{5}} \\\\ \\\\text{s} \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the period is:\\n\\\\[ \\\\boxed{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2\\\\sqrt{5}}} \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 4: Sketch the Graph of Acceleration vs Time\\nGiven that the displacement is zero and the velocity is positive at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), the acceleration at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) is also zero. The acceleration \\\\(a\\\\) varies sinusoidally with time.

The amplitude of the acceleration will be \\\\(20 \\\\ \\\\text{m/s}^2\\\\), varying sinusoidally between \\\\(-20 \\\\ \\\\text{m/s}^2\\\\) and \\\\(20 \\\\ \\\\text{m/s}^2\\\\).\\n\\nHere's a rough sketch of the graph with labeled axes (note that this is a textual representation; you can use the provided grid to create the actual sketch):\\n\\n- \\\\(a\\\\) on the y-axis, ranging from \\\\(-20\\\\) to \\\\(20 \\\\ \\\\text{m/s}^2\\\\).\\n- \\\\(t\\\\) on the x-axis, ranging from \\\\(0\\\\) to \\\\(2T\\\\) where \\\\(2T = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{5}} \\\\ \\\\text{s}\\\\).\\n\\nThe graph will look like a cosine wave starting from zero and cycling through two complete periods.",
      "d": "To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\\n\\n### Step 1: Calculate the Gradient of the Graph\\nThe graph shows the relationship between acceleration \\\\(a\\\\) and displacement \\\\(x\\\\) for a particle undergoing simple harmonic motion. The relationship is given by \\\\(a = -\\\\omega^2 x\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. The gradient of the graph is the coefficient of \\\\(x\\\\), which is \\\\(-\\\\omega^2\\\\).\\n\\nLet's assume from the graph that the maximum acceleration \\\\(a_{\\\\text{max}}\\\\) is 10 units and the maximum displacement \\\\(x_{\\\\text{max}}\\\\) is 2 units. The gradient of the graph is the slope of the line, which is:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Gradient} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta a}{\\\\Delta x} = \\\\frac{-10 \\\\text{ units}}{2 \\\\text{ units}} = -5\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSo, the gradient is \\\\(-5\\\\). This means \\\\(-\\\\omega^2 = -5\\\\), so \\\\(\\\\omega^2 = 5\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega = \\\\sqrt{5}\\\\).\\n\\n### Step 2: Deducing the Frequency\\nThe frequency \\\\(f\\\\) is related to the angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) by the equation:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\omega = 2\\\\pi f\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n\\\\[\\nf = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2\\\\pi} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}}{2\\\\pi}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Step 3: Calculate the Period\\nThe period \\\\(T\\\\) is the reciprocal of the frequency:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nT = \\\\frac{1}{f} = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{5}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Step 4: Sketch the Graph of Acceleration vs Time\\nThe acceleration \\\\(a\\\\) as a function of time \\\\(t\\\\) for simple harmonic motion is given by:\\n\\n\\\\[\\na(t) = -\\\\omega^2 A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSince the displacement is zero and the velocity is positive at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), the particle is passing through the equilibrium position and moving to the positive direction. This means the cosine function will be zero at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and the sine function will be maximum. So, the acceleration will be:\\n\\n\\\\[\\na(t) = -\\\\omega^2 A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) = -5 A \\\\cos(\\\\sqrt{5} t)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWe can sketch the graph with two complete cycles. The period \\\\(T = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{5}} \\\\approx 2.82\\\\) seconds. So, two complete cycles will be \\\\(2 \\\\times 2.82 = 5.64\\\\) seconds. We can choose the amplitude of the acceleration to be 10 units for simplicity.\\n\\nThe graph will look like a cosine wave that is inverted (negative cosine wave) with amplitude 10 units and period 2.82 seconds.\\n\\nThe final answers are:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{-5}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}}{2\\\\pi}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{5}}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nAnd the sketch of the graph of acceleration against time is a negative cosine wave with amplitude 10 units and period 2.82 seconds."

    "text": "### Paragraph for Questions 13 and 14\nThe top is particularly important example of the conservation of angular momentum, because it exemplifies the behaviour of any spinning object in a force - field. As such it has important application to the discussion of rotating atomic and nuclear particles. Consider a top of mass $m$ which, when viewed, is spinning in a counter - clockwise direction with angular momentum $\\vec{L}$. By convention, this is indicated by a vector length $\\vec{L}$ that points outward along the axis OA of the top as shown in figure - 1.\nIf the top is not upright, then the weight force $mg$ vertically down will provide a torque $\\vec{\\tau}$ about point O in the base of the top, which must tend to produce an increase in angular momentum in the direction of that torque. This direction will always be perpendicular to the direction of $\\vec{L}$; hence this torque can never change the magnitude of $\\vec{L}$, but only it direction. It is seen that $\\vec{L}$, and hence the axis of the top, will precess around in a circle about the vertical line $z$ - axis. \n(a) the centre of mass of the top is seen to be at a distance $r$ from the vertical. Consequently the torque is of magnitude: $\\tau=mgr$ This is, then, the magnitude of the rate of change of angular momentum $\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt}$.\n(b) the angular momentum is depicted as precessing about the vertical with angular velocity $\\omega'=\\frac{d\\varphi}{dt}=\\frac{\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt}\\sin\\theta}{L\\sin\\theta}=\\frac{\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt}}{L}=\\frac{mgr}{L}=\\frac{mgh}{L}=\\frac{mgh}{I\\omega}$, where $h$ is the distance from the centre of mass to the base of the top, and $r = h\\sin\\theta$.\nFor the top shown, is made of ring of mass $m$ radius $R$ with three identical rods each of mass $m$ and length $R$ as shown in figure - 3. The dimension and mass of the central rod which behaves as axis of top is negligible.\nNow answer the following questions:\n13. If $m = 100g$, $R=4cm$, $h = 10cm$ and $\\omega = 10rad/s$, then find the value of $\\omega'$.\n(A) $10rad/s$\n(B) $62.5rad/s$\n(C) $31.25rad/s$\n(D) none\n14.

      "c": "The electric field at point \\( x \\) is determined by considering only the glass rod's influence.",
      "d": "**Step 1** The electric field at point x will be due to the rod and the spherical balloon. Using a diagram of the direction of electric field, where \\(\\vec{E}_n\\) is the net electric filed, \\(\\vec{E}_r\\) is the field by rod and \\(\\vec{E}_s\\) is field by sphere. Explanation: The electric field is the space around a charge where the electric force effect can be seen. **Step 2** The net electric field will be, \\(\\vec{E}_n=\\vec{E}_r + \\vec{E}_s\\ (1)\\) The electric field due to rod will be, \\(\\vec{E}_r=-\\frac{k2\\lambda}{r_r}\\hat{j}\\ (2)\\) where \\(\\lambda\\) is the charge per unit length and \\(r_r\\) is the distance between the rod and the point x. The electric field due to the sphere is, \\(\\vec{E}_s=\\frac{kq}{r_s^2}\\hat{i}\\ (3)\\) where q is charge on the sphere and \\(r_s\\) is distance from the sphere.

Due to the symmetry of the semicircle about the $y$ - axis, the $x$ - components of the electric - field contributions from the charges on the left - hand side and the right - hand side of the $y$ - axis will cancel out. So, the net electric field at the center of the semicircle will be along the $y$ - axis.\nLet's consider a small charge element $dq$ on the semicircle.

The weight of the leg below the knee is $48.0\\ N$, with the center of gravity located below the knee joint. The leg is being held in this position because of the force $\\vec{M}$ applied by the quadriceps muscle, which is attached $0.100\\ m$ below the knee joint (see the drawing). Obtain the magnitude of $\\vec{M}$.\nKnee joint is marked. The force $\\vec{M}$ makes an angle of $25.0^{\\circ}$ with the line of action related to the leg - muscle connection. The distance from the knee - joint to the point of muscle attachment is $0.100\\ m$, and the distance from the knee - joint to the center of gravity ($cg$) of the leg below the knee is $0.150\\ m$. The leg makes an angle of $30.0^{\\circ}$ with the horizontal.\nWe will use the principle of torque equilibrium. The sum of the torques about the knee - joint is zero, $\\sum\\tau = 0$.\nThe weight of the leg $W = 48.0\\ N$ creates a clock - wise torque $\\tau_{W}$, and the force $\\vec{M}$ creates a counter - clockwise torque $\\tau_{M}$.\nThe torque due to a force $\\vec{F}$ is given by $\\tau=rF\\sin\\theta$, where $r$ is the distance from the pivot point to the point of application of the force, $F$ is the magnitude of the force, and $\\theta$ is the angle between the position vector $\\vec{r}$ (from the pivot point to the point of application of the force) and the force vector $\\vec{F}$.\nFor the weight of the leg, $r_{W}=0.150\\ m$, $\\theta_{W}=30.0^{\\circ}$, and $F = W = 48.0\\ N$. So the torque due to the weight of the leg is $\\tau_{W}=r_{W}W\\sin\\theta_{W}$.\nFor the force $\\vec{M}$, $r_{M}=0.100\\ m$, $\\theta_{M}=(25.0^{\\circ}+ 30.0^{\\circ})=55.0^{\\circ}$. So the torque due to the force $\\vec{M}$ is $\\tau_{M}=r_{M}M\\sin\\theta_{M}$.\nSince the leg is in rotational equilibrium, $\\sum\\tau=\\tau_{M}-\\tau_{W}=0$, which means $r_{M}M\\sin\\theta_{M}=r_{W}W\\sin\\theta_{W}$.\nWe want to solve for $M$. Rearranging the equation gives:\n$$ M=\\frac{r_{W}W\\sin\\theta_{W}}{r_{M}\\sin\\theta_{M}} $$\nSubstituting the given values: $r_{W} = 0.150\\ m$, $W = 48.0\\ N$, $\\theta_{W}=30.0^{\\circ}$, $r_{M}=0.100\\ m$, and $\\theta_{M}=55.0^{\\circ}$\n$$ M=\\frac{0.150\\times48.0\\times\\sin(30.0^{\\circ})}{0.100\\times\\sin(55.0^{\\circ})} $$\n$$ M=\\frac{0.150\\times48.0\\times0.5}{0.100\\times0.819} $$\n$$ M=\\frac{3.6}{0.0819}\\approx43.96\\ N $$\nNumber: $44.0$ (rounded to one decimal place)\nUnits: $N$\n<image>",

The firefly is to the right of the mirror, on the mirror's optic axis, and serves as a real object for the mirror. You want to determine how far the object must be from the mirror's vertex (that is, object distance $s$) to produce an image of a specified height. First you place a square of white cardboard to the right of the object and find what its distance from the vertex needs to be so that the image is sharply focused on it. Next you measure the height of the sharply focused images for five values of $s$. For each $s$ value, you then calculate the lateral magnification $m$.

A fuel-air mixture is sprayed into the cylinder at point 1, where the piston is at its farthest distance from the spark plug. This mixture is compressed as the piston moves toward the spark plug during the adiabatic compression stroke. The spark plug fires at point 2, releasing heat energy that had been stored in the gasoline. The fuel burns so quickly that the piston doesn't have time to move, so the heating is an isochoric process. The hot, high-pressure gas then pushes the piston outward during the power stroke. Finally, an exhaust valve opens to allow the gas temperature and pressure to drop back to their initial values before starting the cycle over again.",

It is similar to the Otto cycle (see Problem CP19.71), but there are two important differences. First, the fuel is not admitted until the air is fully compressed at point 2. Because of the high temperature at the end of an adiabatic compression, the fuel begins to burn spontaneously. (There are no spark plugs in a diesel engine!) Second, combustion takes place more slowly, with fuel continuing to be injected. This makes the ignition stage a constant-pressure process. The cycle shown, for one cylinder of a diesel engine, has a displacement $V_{\\text{max}} - V_{\text{min}}$ of $1000 \\, \\text{cm}^3$ and a compression ratio $r = V_{\\text{max}} / V_{\\text{min}} = 21$.

    "text": "What was the energy difference \\( E\\_2 - E\\_1 \\) for that emission?\n\nComet stimulated emission. When a comet approaches the Sun, the increased warmth evaporates water from the ice on the surface of the comet nucleus, producing a thin atmosphere of water vapor around the nucleus. Sunlight can then dissociate H\\_2O molecules in the vapor to H atoms and OH molecules. The sunlight can also excite the OH molecules to higher energy levels. When the comet is still relatively far from the Sun, the sunlight causes equal excitation to the \\( E\\_2 \\) and \\( E\\_1 \\) levels. Hence, there is no population inversion between the two levels. However, as the comet approaches the Sun, the excitation to the \\( E\\_1 \\) level decreases and population inversion occurs. The reason has to do with Fraunhofer lines. As a comet approaches the Sun, the Doppler effect due to the comet's speed relative to the Sun shifts the Fraunhofer lines in wavelength, overlapping one of them with the wavelength required for excitation to the \\( E\\_1 \\) level in OH molecules. Population inversion occurs in those molecules, and they radiate stimulated emission at about \\( 1666\\text\\{ MHz \\} \\).",

Two of these can be used to eliminate $C$ and $D$, and the other two can be \"solved\" for $B$ and $F$ in terms of $A$ and $G$: $$B = S_{11}A + S_{12}G, \\quad F = S_{21}A + S_{22}G.$$ The four coefficients $S_{ij}$, which depend on $k$ (and hence on $E$), constitute a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\mathbf{S}$, called the scattering matrix (or $S$-matrix, for short). The $S$-matrix tells you the outgoing amplitudes ($B$ and $F$) in terms of the incoming amplitudes ($A$ and $G$): $$\begin{pmatrix} B \\ F \\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} S_{11} & S_{12} \\ S_{21} & S_{22} \\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A \\ G \\end{pmatrix}.$$ In the typical case of scattering from the left, $G = 0$, so the reflection and transmission coefficients are $$R_L = \\left| \\frac{B}{A} \right|_{G=0}^2 = |S_{11}|^2, \\quad T_L = \\left| \\frac{F}{A} \right|_{G=0}^2 = |S_{21}|^2.$$ For scattering from the right, $A = 0$, and $$R_R = \\left| \\frac{F}{G} \right|_{A=0}^2 = |S_{22}|^2, \\quad T_R = \\left| \\frac{B}{G} \right|_{A=0}^2 = |S_{12}|^2.$$",

Most of the molecules are $H_2$, but a small fraction of the molecules are carbon monoxide ($CO$). Such a molecular cloud in the constellation Orion is shown in figure. The upper image was made with an ordinary visible-light telescope; the lower image shows the molecular cloud in Orion as imaged with a radio telescope tuned to a wavelength emitted by $CO$ in a rotational transition. The different colors in the radio image indicate regions of the cloud that are moving either toward us (blue) or away from us (red) relative to the motion of the cloud as a whole, as determined by the Doppler shift of the radiation. (Since a molecular cloud has about $10,000$ hydrogen molecules for each $CO$ molecule, it might seem more reasonable to tune a radio telescope to emissions from $H_2$ than to emissions from $CO$.

When a comet approaches the Sun, the increased warmth evaporates water from the ice on the surface of the comet nucleus, producing a thin atmosphere of water vapor around the nucleus. Sunlight can then dissociate H\\_2O molecules in the vapor to H atoms and OH molecules. The sunlight can also excite the OH molecules to higher energy levels. When the comet is still relatively far from the Sun, the sunlight causes equal excitation to the \\( E\\_2 \\) and \\( E\\_1 \\) levels. Hence, there is no population inversion between the two levels. However, as the comet approaches the Sun, the excitation to the \\( E\\_1 \\) level decreases and population inversion occurs. The reason has to do with Fraunhofer lines. As a comet approaches the Sun, the Doppler effect due to the comet's speed relative to the Sun shifts the Fraunhofer lines in wavelength, overlapping one of them with the wavelength required for excitation to the \\( E\\_1 \\) level in OH molecules. Population inversion occurs in those molecules, and they radiate stimulated emission at about \\( 1666\\text\\{ MHz \\} \\).",

There will be four boundary conditions (two joining Regions I and II, and two joining Regions II and III). Two of these can be used to eliminate $C$ and $D$, and the other two can be \"solved\" for $B$ and $F$ in terms of $A$ and $G$: $$B = S_{11}A + S_{12}G, \\quad F = S_{21}A + S_{22}G.$$ The four coefficients $S_{ij}$, which depend on $k$ (and hence on $E$), constitute a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\mathbf{S}$, called the scattering matrix (or $S$-matrix, for short). The $S$-matrix tells you the outgoing amplitudes ($B$ and $F$) in terms of the incoming amplitudes ($A$ and $G$): $$\begin{pmatrix} B \\ F \\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} S_{11} & S_{12} \\ S_{21} & S_{22} \\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A \\ G \\end{pmatrix}.$$ In the typical case of scattering from the left, $G = 0$, so the reflection and transmission coefficients are $$R_L = \\left| \\frac{B}{A} \right|_{G=0}^2 = |S_{11}|^2, \\quad T_L = \\left| \\frac{F}{A} \right|_{G=0}^2 = |S_{21}|^2.$$ For scattering from the right, $A = 0$, and $$R_R = \\left| \\frac{F}{G} \right|_{A=0}^2 = |S_{22}|^2, \\quad T_R = \\left| \\frac{B}{G} \right|_{A=0}^2 = |S_{12}|^2.$$",

A fuel-air mixture is sprayed into the cylinder at point 1, where the piston is at its farthest distance from the spark plug. This mixture is compressed as the piston moves toward the spark plug during the adiabatic compression stroke. The spark plug fires at point 2, releasing heat energy that had been stored in the gasoline. The fuel burns so quickly that the piston doesn't have time to move, so the heating is an isochoric process. The hot, high-pressure gas then pushes the piston outward during the power stroke.

It is similar to the Otto cycle (see Problem CP19.71), but there are two important differences. First, the fuel is not admitted until the air is fully compressed at point 2. Because of the high temperature at the end of an adiabatic compression, the fuel begins to burn spontaneously. (There are no spark plugs in a diesel engine!) Second, combustion takes place more slowly, with fuel continuing to be injected. This makes the ignition stage a constant-pressure process. The cycle shown, for one cylinder of a diesel engine, has a displacement $V_{\\text{max}} - V_{\text{min}}$ of $1000 \\, \\text{cm}^3$ and a compression ratio $r = V_{\\text{max}} / V_{\\text{min}} = 21$.

You want to determine how far the object must be from the mirror's vertex (that is, object distance $s$) to produce an image of a specified height.

    "text": "At the end of the collision, what is the radii of the dent (assuming that the person wearing the armor remains stationary)?\n\nWhen a high-speed projectile such as a bullet or bomb fragment strikes modern body armor, the fabric of the armor stops the projectile and prevents penetration by quickly spreading the projectile's energy over a large area. This spreading is done by longitudinal and transverse pulses that move radially from the impact point, where the projectile pushes a cone-shaped dent into the fabric. The longitudinal pulse, racing along the fibers of the fabric at speed \\(v_l\\) ahead of the denting, causes the fibers to thin and stretch, with material flowing radially inward into the dent. One such radial fiber is shown in figure. Part of the projectile's energy goes into this motion and stretching. The transverse pulse, moving at a slower speed \\(v_t\\), is due to the denting. As the projectile increases the dent's depth, the dent increases in radius, causing the material in the fibers to move in the same direction as the projectile (perpendicular to the transverse pulse's direction of travel). The rest of the projectile's energy goes into this motion. All the energy that does not eventually go into permanently deforming the fibers ends up as thermal energy.
